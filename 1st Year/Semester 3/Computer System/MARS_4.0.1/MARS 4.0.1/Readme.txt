Option B: DOS shell using jar file. Save the jar file in some folder. Open a DOS shell in that folder. Run MARS with the DOS command :                java -jar Mars.jar

Option C: DOS shell using Java classes. Save the jar file in some folder. Open a DOS shell in that folder. Extract MARS files with the DOS command:               jar -xf Mars.jar                       Run MARS with the DOS command  java Mars

Sample MIPS assembly program to run under MARS: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/Fibonacci.asm

A "tool" is the MARS utility for MIPS control of simulated devices, including contention for resources. Sample tool is a Scavenger Hunt, in which each student writes a MIPS subroutine to direct the path of a character to travel to several locations. The companion Java "tool" program graphically displays the position of each character as the Scavenger Hunt game progresses. Interested instructors please contact Ken Vollmar for MIPS assembly solution or further information.
